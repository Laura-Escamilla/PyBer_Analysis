# Pyber_Analysis


**1.	Overview of the an√°lisis**

-	The purpose of the analysis:

In this project we worked for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO.

In this particular analysis we created, with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

**2.	Results:**

-	Ride-sharing data among the different city types. Including the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

We obtained a total of 2,375 trips in the given period, with a total of 2,973 drivers, a total of 4,327.93 in rural fare, 19,356.33 in suburban and 39,854.38 in urban fare. The average fare per type of city is 34.62 in rural, 30.97 in suburban, and 24.52 in urban. On the other hand, the average fare per driver is in rural 55.48, in suburban 39.50 and in urban is 16.57. 

Most trips are in urban cities, less than half are from suburban cities, and rural areas account for only 5% of trips. This tells us that it is in urban areas where it is important to concentrate enough drivers to meet that demand. 

On the other hand, fares are usually higher on rural and suburban trips because they may be fewer but longer trips, however, the bulk of fares and number of trips are in urban cities.

The information described above can be seen reflected in the following image:

- In the next graph we can see the total fare by city type in a given period of January to April:

**3.	Summary:**

-	Business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Seeing that the average fare is much lower in urban cities, I would recommend modifying the calculation for certain trips that benefit the company and the driver by increasing the cost per kilometer traveled since they are surely shorter trips.

2. Determine a fare increase according to the time of day the trips occur. 

3. Determine the rate according to the availability of drivers in urban cities and at the same time make long trips, suburban and rural cities, more attractive to encourage a greater number of trips for the available drivers.
